# Restart-Reminder-Toast-Notifications-via-intune
This PowerShell solution sends Windows toast notifications reminding users to restart their computers based on system uptime. Users can snooze or dismiss reminders, which increase in urgency over time and eventually trigger a forced restart if ignored. Designed for IT admins, it can be deployed through Microsoft Intune.
